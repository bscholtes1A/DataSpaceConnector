# Transfer Functions SPI

This extension contains the SPI for the Transfer Functions feature. 

Transfer functions are endpoints the connector uses to initiate and control data transfers. Currently, HTTP-based functions are supported, which will enable connector operators to 
implement custom data transfer procedures on their technology infrastructure of choice via a simple endpoint interface.
